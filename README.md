Mashenka is a game engine based on Hazel Engine by TheCherno. It is a work in progress and is not ready for use.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2022 or Rider is recommended, Mashenka is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/vladimirSirin/Mashenka`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

## The Plan
This is a demo engine for me to mainly learning Game Engine Architecture and C++.
Plan to finish basic 2D game functionality by the end of 2023 and create first demo game.

### Main features to come:
- Demo Game Project
- Fast 2D rendering (UI, particles, sprites, etc.)
- High-fidelity Physically-Based 3D rendering (this will be expanded later, 2D to come first)
- Support for Mac, Linux, Android and iOS
    - Native rendering API support (DirectX, Vulkan, Metal)
- Fully featured viewer and editor applications
- Fully scripted interaction and behavior
- Integrated 3rd party 2D and 3D physics engine
- Procedural terrain and world generation
- Artificial Intelligence
- Audio system
